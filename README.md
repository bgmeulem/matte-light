# Matte light color theme

It's hard to find light themes out there that don't completely obliterate your eyeballs.
I adapted this theme from [Atom One x Github light](https://github.com/softtama/vscode-theme-atom-one-x-github-light-gray) to be 
a bit darker and lower contrast, and even cleaner. Enjoy!
