# Matte light color theme

This theme is heavily inspired by Atom One x Github light, which I really love.

It's hard to find light themes out there that don't completely obliterate your eyeballs. 
I made this theme to have a soft grey background, clean and non-distracting aesthetic, but still a small pop of color for the highlights.
